### A supply chain marketplace on the Celo Protocol

#### Project Description

In the modern global supply chain system, it's difficult for businesses and individuals to track and verify the movement of goods. There are delays, disputes, increased costs and fraudelent activities.

We want to improve the tracking of goods and services across the supply chain to ensure transparency, reduce fraud  and increase user trust. Without an efficient supply chain; revenue is lost, customers become dissatisfied as the lack of transparency increases the likelihood of fraud.The global supply chain market is projected to reach $46.5 billion by 2030. With the existing innovative blockchain technology in our hands, it's easy to create a secure and tamper-proof record of the entire supply chain that ensures data integrity and reduces fraud.

#### Summary

We present a USSD-based supply chain management system that leverages the power of blockchain technology.

By combining the convenience of USSD communication and transparency of blockchain technology, we have created a secure and efficient system that tracks and verify the movements of goods throughout the supply chain ensuring transparency, reduced fraud and  increase trust among all users.

#### Positive outcomes

- Tamper free record of the supply chain
- Potential for Realtme status of goods and services
- Possible Integration with IOT device providers
